App I would like to develop: 

I am interested in building a school bus tracking app that offers reliable and real time tracking through the means of a cost effective tracker. In the app, I would like to implement a parent log in through which they can access details about their childs school bus route, as well as their departure and arrival timings in real time and receive alerts about the same through notifications. I also want to create another log in for bus drivers, so that they can report details such as departure time, any issues along the route, etc.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I struggled to find various sections of the xcode app which were required in certain steps, one example being that I struggled to open the storyboard code editor, and after I did, I kept getting an error until I figured out how to correctly place the code in a way so that it works as intended.
